# Bayesian-structured-time-series-analysis-of-federal-funds-rate-from-2020-to-2025
This paper applies Bayesian Structural Time Series models with regime-switching to identify monetary policy regimes in the Federal Funds Rate from 2020-2025. We compare models with informative and weakly informative priors to assess the impact of domain knowledge. Our results successfully identify four distinct regimes: COVID Emergency, Inflation Fighting, Peak Rate Holding, and Rate Normalization. Both models achieve over 91\% regime identification accuracy, with the informative priors model showing better fit (DIC) and slightly better predictions (RMSE). The high regime persistence (98-99\%) confirms the Federal Reserve's tendency to maintain policy stances for extended periods. This framework offers valuable insights for understanding monetary policy shifts and forecasting future rate movements.

The author Haonan Gu independently finishes the analysis of this time series data using both Bayesian statistics and time series analysis skills. Readers should feel free to use the paper's results and methods with proper citation. This is Haonan Gu's another exhibition of financial research skills except from the "US bankruptcy survival analysis project", which is also in the Github.
